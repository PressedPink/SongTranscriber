Body Lego, Blots, Nickolat, Bruno, Collie, Brains, Kind creatures, Wallace and Bricks, Heavy on a Tooku 7. I'm in Cook County, AKA Crook County, baking Red Velvet, Drokates and Kush Bros, drinking Weed Tea, rolling Purple Hags, in the Green Leaf, lacing on my Jazz, Risk Breeze. Let me count the Wags, I make it look easy, hopping off the Ranch, in them Kind Yeezys, off the Diamond Chain. You cannot be me, we are not the same. I'm a concrete king jumping off the plate, until it drops GT, and not the same. 

Breathe deep in that Bent-Lung Choppin' Blags, on my Special ED, cause I got it next. Still revving the Blags, ice when you know the name, from the County of Wayne, Detroit, it's Buddy Jack. In that Escalade, kinda creature, damn, I'm a when that p gy. 

I'm a shooter, fuck a morgue when that fence still get drug. I'm a shooter, I done seen it all, been through it all. It's the ball man, ball block, kind creature, everybody know fair. With the ball team, neighborhood dope man, run shit, watch me through a front flip, no hands, shoot the pump at your dough man. Both them bricks better get with the program. Plus my niggas want a north end, screws loose too, that's a lose lose. 

Fuck bitches get more ends. You get no money chasing pussy beforehand. You get more pussy chasing money to blow fast. Now I got money and pussy in both hands. Rolling cush in a row tent, on ten don't push me, I'm on edge. All grown up, I'm a grown man, show you no man. I'm comfortable in my own.
