Second love shows speech, Cuz we all are natural bond friends. You didn't turn those love making tricks from me. You better be gonna have a rubber down. You better be going to the world of class. Or you just grew up to leave. Oh, I wanna stay here. I know baby. She know I still crack and I don't dick. She old she peel back as I roll away. She want the kid back when there's no trench. But no worry happy I'm home safe. No where were you at when I'm gone late. So I'm chilling in the hood. I'm flipping drugs in the jigs. No, I don't tell her like I shit. And then I love her to death. And she like it rough. Bill Pup who hugging her neck. Both on my dick. Hair pinned up with a clip. She hugging my waist while I'm hugging the strip. She does what I say when I'm tugging her head. She jump when I click it. Flip with a blink of the wrist. One time coulda swore I was hit. She love what I'm doing. Nothing up on the strip. When we cut and we kiss. She want a minute snuggly. My face she busting her piss. I dunked her once but it was me. I'mma pack with the brothers and men. It's just me and my bitch. You made me buck wild. Shooting in the crowd. This a ghetto child running wild. From the mob. Shorty with the 40 cow. Only blow the loud. But the smoke be like a black and mild. In alligator city. Popo's is cracker dogs cracking down. But it's more than one way to skin a cow. Can't take it with me. So I'm cashing out. Jackie Brown walked in the club. And they ain't patting down. Hopping no teeth. But now I'm back in town. Brought the bag back in the trap. And the bag get down. Whole brick of yank. Serene rapping palms. No diplomat. No cap and gun. No surrender. No retreat. No backing down. I know niggas in the street. Never had a thought. That it kill you for a G. And crack a smile. And the last thing you will see. Is Jackie Brown. Girl you may be a flirt. I had a blue-headed skrrt. I'mma dance in town. Like a bottom hole. Just give me my respect. I can wear your dresses up to your neck. Street, baby, I'mma dance. I'mma dance in town.
