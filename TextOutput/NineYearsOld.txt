I hope you got the baddest from a swag on, smoking all that cushions to that pack, go run and see your bitch like you for that, whoa, fly nigga, give my chat the act on, yeah. 
I be balling all these niggas I don't need a court, coat white Porsche, got Bodie from the gravel court, taking tricks, so see, just a shit on mark, dropping babies in the hood like a fucking storm.
Nigga how you gon' start on a stutter, lil' nigga putting 30s on a home, and that's the winner with weighty, so summer I'm a poor that raw reality that's worth taking mother, hear that girl in the paper, she a bingo with some plumber.
I just let the bitch out, fuck on top of the covers, bad pull up, be balling in the gutter, and I point a chopper out and make your mama fuck a sucker, what up, nigga?
