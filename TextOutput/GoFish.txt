Brains, Nazareth, good my dog, kind creatures, six oil boys, all these blocks, two two seven, yeah black, it's no success without struggle, that's why I hustle, free, meaty and a fan, thinking for what my cousin told me this a jig, so I puzzle and the pieces of a man is in the heart of the humble, reach down and dig and you can tell who love you, deep down within, unconditionally, unintentionally. 

If I gotta carry a gun every time we do a deal then this trust issues with me, we agree, to disagree, that's the difference between you and me. 

Anybody can be touched some easier than others, we all we got, am I my brother's keeper, we supposed to be brothers, findest keepest the life of a kind creature, it's losers, weepers, move your feet or lose your seat, ever since when fish ride plastic, they like who that kind creature cool kid, ain't it obvious that he the coolest, cool, he called chilling and crust groving, calling, he the meaning of what cool is, cool is, cause cool is what cool does and he was schooling, the odd niggas on the school bus fool, but don't get him confused with this music and do something stupid, do their ones and twos with checks and swooshes, up next is the honorary cool kid, one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish, put black mags on a dino to a mow pit, sun kiss, moon miss, jelly fish, blow fish, in the pot, regs, pot full of gold fish, one zip, two spits, three spits, old trips, when fish ride plastic was gold fish. 

No sin is greater than the next, cause your own fam will play you to the left, when you do wrong for all the right reasons, the same niggas you feed are catered to your death, imposters, they hate what they can't conquer, so they label you a threat, when they don't understand what angle you coming from, they angling they guns, somebody mama crammed, so respect who respect your room, until he disrespect you, then you show him otherwise, in the house of pain, I became a man when I put beside my child's ways and trust in the Lord.
