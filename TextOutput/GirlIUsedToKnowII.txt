Jeff and Ty Creach Ooh, me? Lots I'm in the middle of the street Where it's a thin line between love and hate Woman and mankind, crooked ass police And them stand up guys who with guns in your face Got you catching up with guys when the bullets get chased Now you running out of time. My very first case was a tenth homicide. Tried to send me upstate. I was looking at a dime, a twenty some odd years. I'd rather get tried by a jury of my peers. For you hearing that I died, worst case scenario a nigga got a rap. Ten percent than that. This ain't the first time I had a million dollar burn. Got your men on the stand telling bold face lies. The truth always comes to the light. You measure being now you lie. Always looking man in his eyes. I've always been a stand up guy. 

A word I used to know, maybe Another face on the street A word I used to know, maybe Another face on the street It wasn't me. 

It's a classic mix of baby Honest mistake It wasn't me It's a classic mix of baby Honest mistake. 

Now ain't no reason to be speaking to me. The wrong man, it made my fingerprints. You must've checked on the wrong man. Don't show me no pictures. No, I don't know that van, I don't get you. You talking zippers, what you mean on my pants? Listen, Captain, I don't comprehend the questions you asking. The pills that was found, I thought they was asked. And I swear, that's my granny, she don't say I was deaf. And what you got in that description, trust me I never will. 

I'll find you another goofy, cause me I'm a icon. If nothing's in the skin, then you can give me my eye bond. I ain't a snitch and this ain't first 48. I know a snake when I see him, that's why I'm fucked with the Jakes. Could be telling you anything. But I ain't going, fuck a public defender, my nigga I gotta know you. 

But I used to know, maybe Another face on the street It wasn't me. But I used to know, maybe Another face on the street It wasn't me.
