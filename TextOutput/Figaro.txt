Yeah, n***a, going blocks, yeah, on the zone with this s***, man, on the block with the teeth, yeah, uh, catch up clowns, yeah, my rhymes in the zone, I be vibing like a phone. You gon' need to speed belt my mind out of control, overload you with dope lyrics, so potent, make water down material with smoke screen. The reflection in the mirror is the real me, and it's never been more clearer in my vision. More peers than enemies, since negative energy cut 'em loose or get rid of heat. I speak the lingo of the street, it's not a game but it's bingo when you single down beef, bringing out the heat for any complications. No box in the s***, man, meet the Glock or the K, think another way to make some paper, blanking out on beats I feel my soul escape. This is what the world created, the most hated, your girl favorite, my word is the stage, yeah, uh. 

If you ain't n***a do any f***, you n***as lit a f***, cause in the muck it's the same original ruck, I got these n***as in the figure folk, we're in the folk, with more three one three links, that hanger rock, same Valentine's Day massacre, packing the mac in the back of that great acuad Dracula, vampire drug, gay traffic, a flippin' flapjacks, no pink spatula. 

When I step up to the podium they get a magnifolia, my flow is a carantula, and what a tangle we're in we weed, that's more things to a giant and I'm feeling gargantu, why you amateur night at the Apollo, n***as getting created by the heavyweight champion hit me, my right hook left from staggering, like I'm Marvin the marvelous agala. When I'm in the ring, or in the thick of things, the busy thing and the friends and the man in your slimes, I think I'm wolverine, blow you the smithereens, let you pussies bleed in the same void your pain is in, if you ain't in it, the windy f***in n****s live in the folk, cause in the mof it's the same old rig of the mof, I got these n****s in the thick of folk, we're in the folk, with more three one three links than the thick of mof, how me too with the block the streets live in me, a bad boy for real, I got some big in me, how do you dirty the slaughter and the glory, I ain't scared of skit dying broke my only word, but I'm a hustler, why you think the ship's come fast, I ain't seen enough work to get the rico tag, you piece to my n****s I done lost a few, shocks to my n****s locked, yeah I'm in shorts, I go hard on these bags when I'm hitting my goat, they be mad when I'm rocking all the s*** with the glue, I don't care though, Bodhi got the throttle on chill, he a pop a n***a hollow without swallowing pills, I go in the field, get shot when it's off of the sprigs, n****s do some wild s*** for them big head bills, self made from the block to the boot, hands on with the game, move out to true sun, if you ain't needed to win it, f*** you n****s live in the folk, cause in the mof it's the same old rig of a ruck, I got these n****s in the thick of your f***, with more 313 links than a figure ruff.
