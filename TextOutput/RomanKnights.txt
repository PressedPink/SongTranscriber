2, 2, 7, Hell like
It's kind of creatures, balls and bricks 
Sittin' Sawyer boys, 4K, that money gang, hoops 
My pockets full of hope, I'm full of smoke 
Watchin' my life go down 'cause now I'm dealin' dope 
Let the blunt burn, that's the switcher flows 
I used to sell the coke in the Manila envelopes 
As the world turns, I'm spinnin' spokes 
This old hair from the hood thought it was a joke 
But it was once said, keep my enemies close 
He left it at the crib the day he needed it most 
Got down on me, so like a piece of toast 
When I popped up he was lookin' like he seen a ghost 
What up, 9 homie? Pull it up and pull it out on him, fuck around 
Get you and your people smokin' 
Custom-6 Sawyer boys easily provoked 
My project cut Nick to come see your thoughts 
With a butterfly knife that's cut in the clothes 
It's my block, better find another strip to post 
And by the east, go by like we're a woman die 
They out grind every night, can we cross it on the block? 
I got the right, got the tricks, I got the pills 
See dog on the real, I'm a street pharmacist, nigga 
So what you tryin' to feel? Her matter fact just meet me by the field 
How else can I put it, dog, I'm out here 
I'm out here, day after day, and bag after bag 
I'm a savage, I got hand for this motherfuckin' cash 
I go stupid, I go dumb, and I just might spazz 
That's why I'm front shit, so you ain't got no tab 
Cause runnin' off on far cake, boy don't make me laugh 
I'm a money gang, nigga, I'll put this bag on your ass 
Gee boy, I'm bout that gunplay 
That SK, that AK, that 45, that Glock 9 
And don't forget the Trey, aye, and you can get it any day 
Plus I'm rollin' every night, make your ass want thing twice 
I go bath like Romanites
