Verse 1
6'4 like Nintendo Jimbo from McNico 
Yeah, run the power glove Relax Poochoo 
7 Kind of crazy Dirty glove 
What up Jakes I'm on the ground 
Don't worry why did my daughter's call 
I'm still chillin' doing what I do 
On hell blacking me nickels with Rick Rule 
Feeling like a million bucks, Uncle Scrooge 
Fresh as fuck, the number pulls 
Bunch of trillion cuts flooded the jewels 
The truck rimmed it up, look at the shoes 
Riding 26'n up, put up them tools 
Gotta hit me in the dunk, I can never lose 
Might catch me with some chucks and a pair of trills 
How I thought I'm hooked, you think I'm Larry Holmes 
Blowing on that kush, caught me in every hole 
Different strokes, different folks 

Chorus
Gary Cohn stranded on death row
I think I'm Herrio, got the hammer-kite
Super Mario, from the hill block to the burial 
I'm on Six Mile, Mary Grove 
I think I'm Spice One, and it's the murder show 
Lights out, curtains closed 

Verse 2
So I'm outta drag, the curtains curved 
I'm in that White House with the curtains closed 
And I ons to dance, verse through the third 
With the night out, living dirty birds 
The early bird get the worm in it, dirty 
This that HBO, hill block original 
I play the role in real life, I'm a criminal 
Really though, this that HBO Hill block original, gangsta show 

Chorus
This that HBO, hill block original 
I play the role in real life, I'm a criminal 
Really though, this that HBO, hill block original 
Gangsta show 

Verse 3
It's me and Baldi boy, you don't know me boy 
I'm G.T., dirty, good, I be in T 
I love when niggas talk, but don't get it 
I just talk to the plug, he told me six, I ain't chillin' 
I'm with it, everything come to a patient 
Nigga, fast money, get it all day like I'm racing, niggas 
And I ain't even have to run, shit 
All I had to do was hustle, run through zips 
Stack and bubble, take them trips 
I know I might get in trouble, but I take the risk 
Can I pray every time I hop inside I sit my lips, keep die-clops with a catch and ride 
When I get close, I'ma call my ride 

Chorus
Fuck that, I'ma call a cab, it's too hot to drive 
I need you there, you know I got this shit 
G.T., bring this shit home 

Outro

Really though, this that HBO Hill Block Original, Gangsta Show 
This that HBO, Hill Block Original

Really though, this that HBO Hill Block Original, Gangsta Show
