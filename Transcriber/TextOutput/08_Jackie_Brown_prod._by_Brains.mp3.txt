Verse 1:
Second love shows speech, 
Cuz we all are natural bond friends 
You didn't turn those love making tricks from me 
You better be gonna have a rubber down 
You better be going to the world of class 
Or you just grew up to leave 
Oh, I wanna stay here

Chorus 1:
I know baby 
She know I still crack and I don't dick 
She old she peel back as I roll away 
She want the kid back when there's no trench 
But no worry happy I'm home safe 
No where were you at when I'm gone late 
So I'm chilling in the hood 
I'm flipping drugs in the jigs 

Verse 2:
No, I don't tell her like I shit and then 
I love her to death 
And she like it rough 
Bill Pup who hugging her neck 
Roll on my dick 
Hair pinned up with a clip 
She hugging my waist while I'm hugging the strip 
She does what I say when I'm tugging her hips 
She jump when I click and flip 
With a blink of the wrist 
One time coulda swore I was hit 
She love what I'm doing 
Nothing up on the strip 
When we cut on my kicks 
She want a minute snug in my face 
She busting her piss 
I dunked her once, but it was me 
I'm a guy who could rather cement

Chorus 2:
It's just me and my bitch 
I love you baby 
Just the way you talk to me 
I love you too 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 

Verse 3:
You made me buck wild 
Shooting in the crowd 
This a ghetto child running wild 
Running wild from the mob 
Shorty with the 40 cow 
Only blow the loud 
But the smoke be like a black and mild 
In alligator city 
Popos is cracker dogs 
Cracking down 
But there's more than one way to skin a cow 
Can't take it with me 
So I'm cashing out Jackie Brown 
Walk in the club 
And it ain't patting down 
I been no T 
But now I'm back in the club 
I'm a guy who could never stop 

Chorus 3:
I love you 
I love you 
I love you 
But now I'm back in town 
Brought the bag back in the trap 
And the bag it down 
Whole brick of yack 
Surrendering rapping palms 
No diplomat 
No cabin gun 
No surrender 
No retreat 
No back in down 
I know niggas in the street 
Never had a thought 
That it kill you for a G 
And crack a smile 
And the last thing you will see 
Is Jackie Brown 
Girl you may be a flirt 
I had a blue leather mitties 
And I'm dancing tight 
Like a bottom up 
I'm a black and mild 
I'm a black and mild 
I'm a black and mild 
I'm a black and mild 
I'm a black and mild 
I'm a black and mild 
I'm a black and mild 
I'm a black and mild
