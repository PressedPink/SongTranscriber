Chorus:
I'm the dope man, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm the baby hood, work it hard

Verse 1:
A.P. from 46th Street, kind creatures
Body lies on the neighborhood two two seven
From Detroit to Pontiac, Bowtown to Dose City
Decoys and copycats profiling Boy and Nick, yeah

Chorus

Verse 2:
Blowing sticky, getting blowed off a gamble
Got them snoring fickies here, Fros on that year but
Getting money never tricking with these trick hoes
Why you tipping 20s to these strippers and these bimbo
I'm spending 24s, 24k gold
Spinning henny, getting hissy from your main hoes
Getting busy to the river mother tempo
Or we in this busy with them digis and them pinstoves

Chorus

Verse 3:
To University Drive, Say Nick take a deuce and he turn into fat
You can call him Chris Queen, in this murder disguise
If you fuck up my jingles get worried or laugh
No cans, get shoes, no shirt and no ties
Just concrete shoes, river currents and ties

Chorus

Verse 4:
Cause I'm the dope man, Hell block I went in with a bachelor's in every jang
And left out with a master's in cocaine
Sevens off six, hard at a quarter tier
Eleven off ten, Jordan with short appeal
That's 999 quadruple stacks
The one I owe per say that's a brick of X
At $3 a piece get him for 50 cents
You need to holler at me 110%

Chorus

Verse 5:
Out of the profit I reap, the other 140
I'm bout to pocket a G, I bought a Glock for it
Caliber handgun 150 for my mans
Spent the I 250 on the ounce again
Sold 10 25s and a hundred cent
Made a hundred bucks pros plus my money back
The man get my balls spent 50 on this Glock
Got a half-oh again left on the block

Chorus

Verse 6:
What's the shirt? I'm the baby hood
Work it hard, that bright mow brick layer
Boss keep my big homie from the set seat
Bo he get your money and the rest is
Smooth sailing the boat in the set seat
The food catered the coke full of crystal
And glue vapors, so got em on deck
With new papers on top of all racks

Chorus

Verse 7:
Couple hundred thin, you lay a stick
Fuck the rubber bands, we need some paperclips
The money coming in with them cars going out
And on the other end my dog wanna own
Of that purple cuz, put it in the wind
What you working with, shit what you trying to spend?
It's 575, I ride kinda slow
On I75 I I95 I might shove a late dodge with these sticks

Chorus
